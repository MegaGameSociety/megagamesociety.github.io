            <p>
              Part RPG and part board game, our flagship fame "Watch the Skies" brings together 60 players who will play on teams as various nations, news reporters, corporate factions and the alien visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Watch the Skies takes place in a near future Earth very much like our own... but aliens have arrived on the planet. Around 60 players will play on teams as nations, news reporters, and, of course, the aliens, while Earth struggles to figure out what is going on and if they can do it before civilization dissolves into chaos. Nations are represented by players acting as Heads of State, Deputy Heads of State, Chief Scientists, Military Commanders, and Foreign Ministers. Expect exciting battles, research on alien artifacts, espionage, and a version of the United Nations that's a lot more fun than the one you modeled in high school. There's also plenty of mysterious alien intrigue and scrappy press that can make or break the game.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inspired by the recent megagame episode of <a href="http://www.shutupandsitdown.com/blog/post/susd-play-goddamn-megagame/">Shut Up and Sit Down</a> the Megagame Society is happy to bring Watch The Skies to the United States.

        <h3>Upcoming Megagames Under Development</h3>
        <p>We are currently in the process of building four new megagames!</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Watch the Stars (sequal to Watch the Skies, in space!)</li>
          <li>The King Hereafter (set in Shakespeare's Macbeth)</li>
          <li>Lovecraftian Horror the Megagame</li>
          <li>Jane Austen the Megagame</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We are hoping to run at least one of these games by December 2015.  Games being developed are only run once they have been thoroughly playtested</p>

        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <h3>What is a Megagame?</h3>
        <p>
          A megagame is a game, only bigger. Mega bigger. Part board game, part rpg, a megagame is made up of several simultaneous, interlocking games, that join together to create one giant story that plays out over the course of the day. The basic rules of the game might be constant but thanks to player tactics, ingenuity and plain old bluffing, every game is an entirely unique narrative.
        </p>
        <h3>When will you be hosting an event in (Insert City Here)?</h3>
        <p>
          We are working on multiple groups in multiple cities.  You can contact us about potentially using our materials to set up your own games!
        </p>
        <h3>How can I help?</h3>
        <p>
          You can fill out this <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/wmk4LesrXf">form</a>.  We'd love to have your help.
        </p>
        <h3>What about running a Megagame in my own Hometown or Company?</h3>
        <p>
        Megagames are an amazing experience you can bring to your own city!  If you'd like to run one of our games in your city you can <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/RKfgQN8Y2b">contact us</a> to help get you setup.  We recommend watching one of our <a href="https://youtu.be/jwgaclzAn0E">Q&A sessions</a> that we recorded which answers most questions on how to run a megagame/what you'll need.</p>
        <p>
        We ask for a 10% of ticket sales fee when running our megagame and selling tickets to the public.  We use the fee to pay our graphic designers, video editors, app development costs for our upcoming control app (for easier game management) and server costs to host the app.  We operate as a non profit and the executive team does not draw a salary.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to run the game as a corporate team building event or run the game at a convention contact us and we can help get you setup and discuss licensing options!</p>
      </p>
      <h3>Who made that awesome art?</h3>
        <p>
          The art for Megagame Society was produced by the amazingly talented <a href="http://raminrahni.com/">Ramin Rahni</a>, Will Verdoni, and Juliet Hitchner.  Ramin also designed Megagame Society's logo while Will Verdoni designed the logo for Watch the Skies! 
        </p>
