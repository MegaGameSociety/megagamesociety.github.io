        <h3>What is a Megagame?</h3>
        <p>
          A megagame is a game, only bigger. Mega bigger. Part board game, part rpg, a megagame is made up of several simultaneous, interlocking games, that join together to create one giant story that plays out over the course of the day. The basic rules of the game might be constant but thanks to player tactics, ingenuity and plain old bluffing, every game is an entirely unique narrative.
        </p>

        <div class="game">
          <h3>Watch the Skies!</h3>
          <img src="images/WatchTheSkiesLogo.png" />
          <div class="synopsis">
            <p>
              Part RPG and part board game, our flagship fame "Watch the Skies" brings together 60 players who will play on teams as various nations, news reporters, corporate factions and the alien visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Watch the Skies takes place in a near future Earth very much like our own… but aliens have arrived on the planet. Around 60 players will play on teams as nations, news reporters, and, of course, the aliens, while Earth struggles to figure out what is going on and if they can do it before civilization dissolves into chaos. Nations are represented by players acting as Heads of State, Deputy Heads of State, Chief Scientists, Military Commanders, and Foreign Ministers. Expect exciting battles, research on alien artifacts, espionage, and a version of the United Nations that’s a lot more fun than the one you modeled in high school. There’s also plenty of mysterious alien intrigue and scrappy press that can make or break the game.
            </p>

              Inspired by the recent megagame episode of <a href="http://www.shutupandsitdown.com/blog/post/susd-play-goddamn-megagame/">Shut Up and Sit Down</a> the Megagame Society is happy to bring Watch The Skies to the United States.
